				My name is Derrick Wong and I am the eldest of three children. I consider myself a very 
				affects how I act. On a normal day though, I like to read words and it could be from anywhere. 
				The words could come from the giant billboards above buildings or the tiny text on your 
				newspaper that you just finished. I enjoy reading words and find a way to use them or finding 
				out what the definition of them.

				I enjoy finding and playing new games. My favorite genre of games tends to fall towards 
				RPGs and strategy type games such as Mario and chess. Those type of games seem to the 
				bring the most satisfaction when I clear or beat them. I do play games outside of those genres 
				but it&#39;s not a very common thing.

			I enjoy being in quiet and peaceful atmospheres that allows me to clear my mind. Being in such atmospheres allows me to read and process words better than in a loud and disruptive atmosphere. It allows my thought process to work more efficiently in a sense that I can think about what actions I will be able to take and not take rash decisions. High risk and high reward but at what cost for failure. Playing safe may not carry me forever at least I&#39;m taking a safer route with less consequences for failure. I rather not gamble my life away.
